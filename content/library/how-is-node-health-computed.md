# How is Node Health Computed?

The **Node Health Page** is responsible for showing how the Node's health is computed.

The **Overall Health** is computed by averaging all object and alert health.

## Discrepency Messaging

Do see you see a message like this?

- "3 not found, 2 extra samples"
- OR "3 not found"
- OR "2 extra samples"

This indicates a discrepenancy between the object and its respective sample data. This should never happen. If it does, please contact us and we wil fix the issue.
