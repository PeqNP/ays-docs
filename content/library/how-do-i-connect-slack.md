# How Do I Connect Slack?

To integrate Slack, you must first install the Slack app in your organization's Slack workspace.

To do this, open **@ys**, and navigate to the root node of your organization. (i.e. `com.bithead`)

- Update the root node (Tap on `Update` mode and then tap the root node)
- Tap on "Organization Configuration"
- Tap on "Connect Slack"

This will open Safari.

- Install and provide permissions to the **@ys** app for your workspace.
- After you have connected the app, you will be redirected to a simple page that provides you with a six character **Slack Registration Code**. Copy the code.
- Go back to **@ys** and paste the code in the modal

The last step is to add the **@ys** app to the channels you wish to receive messages. To do this

- Navigate to the Slack channel you wish to recieve **@ys** alerts
- Tap the channel's title at the top (it has the downward caret)
- Tap on the "Integrations" tab
- Tap on the "Add app" link
- From there, select **@ys**

Your Slack workspace is now connected to your **@ys** organization and ready to receive alerts.
