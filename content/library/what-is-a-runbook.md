# What Is a Runbook?

When an issue occurs with a service, it is important to know what steps can be taken to quickly resolve the issue. This is the purpose of a runbook. It is a "how-to" guide to help new, and experienced, operators to resolve common problems that a service may encounter.

For example, a runbook may contain instructions on how to restart a service, provide definitions and steps to resolve issues for a service's error codes, etc.

A link to your runbook will be accessible from a measurement's graph and alert notifications.
