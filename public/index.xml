      <title>How Is Node Health Determined</title>

      <description>How Is Node Health Determined? A node&amp;rsquo;s health is determined by averaging all of the health values of its measurements, children, dependencies, and external system measurements.
If a node&amp;rsquo;s health changes, those changes will be propagated and affect the health of all of its dependents and parents. The algorithm walks backwards up the system graph until it reaches each organization node.
For example, if a node (which will we refer to as node &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;) is a dependency to node &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo;, then node B&amp;rsquo;s health will be affected by node A&amp;rsquo;s health by virtue of it being dependent on node A.</description>

      <title>What Is a Template Node</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/help/library/what-is-a-template-node/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/help/library/what-is-a-template-node/</guid>
      <description>What Is a Template Node? A template node is designed to represent a type of system in your organization. You use them to measure like systems in the same way.
They can also represent a common utility. For example, Bithead has several utility template nodes such as com.bithead.template.ping and com.bithead.template.query.
Another way to think of template nodes as that they are composed of a common library of functions (measurements).
For example, imagine you have a group of services that send data to New Relic.</description>

      <description>How Do I Connect Slack? To integrate Slack, you must first install the Slack app in your organization&amp;rsquo;s Slack workspace.
To do this, open @ys, and navigate to the root node of your organization. (i.e. com.bithead)
Update the root node (Tap on Update mode and then tap the root node) Tap on &amp;ldquo;Organization Configuration&amp;rdquo; Tap on &amp;ldquo;Connect Slack&amp;rdquo; This will open Safari.
Install and provide permissions to the @ys app for your workspace.</description>

      <description>How Do I Configure New Relic? Configuring New Relic requires three flows:
Associating the New Relic Entity GUID to an @ys Node Creating a New Relic webhook that sends alerts to the @ys webhook service Configuring policies to send condition alerts to the @ys webhook Associating New Relic Entity GUID to @ys Node Sign in to your New Relic account.
Go to &amp;ldquo;All Entities.&amp;rdquo;
On the entity you wish to track, such as an iOS app, tap the ellipses button at the right-most of the cell.</description>

      <title>What Is External Alerting Config</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/help/library/what-is-external-alerting-config/</guid>
      <description>What is External Alerting Config? An external system, such as Embrace and NewRelic, may be configured to send alerts to @ys.
This is the easiest and fastest way to determine the health of your systems if you have already configured your apps, services, etc. with an external alerting system.
External alerting configuration are treated as &amp;ldquo;virtual measurements.&amp;rdquo; In other words, an external alert (e.g. a &amp;ldquo;Condition&amp;rdquo; in NewRelic or an &amp;ldquo;Alert&amp;rdquo; in Embrace) is similar to an @ys Measurement.</description>

      <title>What Is a Node Relationship?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/help/library/what-is-a-node-relationship/</guid>
      <description>Node Relationships Node relationships are the logical groupings of parent and children nodes, and the dependent relationships between nodes.
Parent / child relationships are a typical Tree data structure.
Dependent relationships are defined by a node A depending on another node B for its operation. Imagine you are building a retail app that sells shoes. Your app may depend on a &amp;ldquo;Product&amp;rdquo; service, which gives you SKU level detail about your shoes, and a &amp;ldquo;Checkout&amp;rdquo; service which allows you to purchase a pair of shoes.</description>

      <description>Measurements A measurement is the combination of a sensor (data source) and threshold configuration.
Sensor A sensor can be
a script that is executed at a configured interval (i.e. every 1 minute) a service that sends data points directly to @ys The most common sensor type is a (Python) script that queries an external data source such as New Relic, Datadog, etc. Each time the script runs, @ys will query the data source and log the return value.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/help/library/what-is-node-alert-config/</guid>
      <description>Node Alerting Configuration Alerting configuration works like a typical logging system where you can filter what messages are logged depending on the configured &amp;ldquo;level.&amp;rdquo; For example, in production you may configure your logging level to &amp;ldquo;Error.&amp;rdquo; Any logs emitted at a logging level lower than &amp;ldquo;Error&amp;rdquo; (Debug, Info, Warning) will not be emitted.
This form provides a way to configure this &amp;ldquo;logging level.&amp;rdquo; Actions configured to Children and Dependencies will trigger if their health level breaches the respective Warning, Error, or Critical level.</description>

      <description>Runbooks When an issue occurs with a service, it is important to know what steps can be taken to quickly resolve the issue. This is the purpose of a runbook. It is a &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; guide to help new, and experienced, operators to resolve common problems that a service may encounter.
For example, a runbook may contain instructions on how to restart a service, provide definitions and steps to resolve issues for a service&amp;rsquo;s error codes, etc.</description>

      <description>Virtual Nodes Virtual nodes are read-only nodes which inherit all properties from a template node. They may only be created, updated, or deleted from their parent node.
Virtual modes can be considered as ephemeral, although their life span depends on the context.
The typical use case for virtual nodes is that you wish to quickly assign the same measurements to many nodes. In other words, they represent an asset or service that share the same properties.</description>

      <title>Invalid Call Parameters</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/help/library/invalid-call-parameters/</guid>
      <description>Invalid Call Parameters This error occurs when one or more sensor parameters are not configured. Depending on the sensor parameter, it either needs to be a string with one or more characters or a numeric value for integer and double types.
Please configure the measurement sensor parameters with a value.
Below is an example of a string sensor parameter that is not configured. In this context, simply add a value with one or more characters.</description>

      <description>Read-only Threshold When a Threshold is set as &amp;ldquo;read-only&amp;rdquo;, all other nodes that template from this measurement will be unable to change the configuration values of threshold actions.
Imagine you have a group of services which must send all alerting traffic to a specific Slack channel. You would turn on &amp;ldquo;read-only&amp;rdquo; in this context. In essence, this creates a central configuration point for your alerting configuration.
If you are creating a measurement template which will be used by many teams within (or outside) of your organization, the configuration values will most likely be different per team.</description>
