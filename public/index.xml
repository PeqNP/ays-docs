      <description>Node Alerting Configuration Alerting configuration works like a typical logging system where you can filter what messages are logged depending on the configured &amp;ldquo;level&amp;rdquo;. For example, in production you may configure your logging level to &amp;ldquo;Error.&amp;rdquo; Any logs emitted at a lower logging level than &amp;ldquo;Error&amp;rdquo; (Debug, Info, Warning) will not be emitted.
This form provides a way to configure this &amp;ldquo;logging level.&amp;rdquo; Actions configured to the respective group (Children, Dependencies, and Measurements) will not trigger unless the respective threshold level has been breached.</description>

      <description>What Is a Runbook? When an issue occurs with a service, it is important to know what steps can be taken to quickly resolve the issue. This is the purpose of a runbook. It is a &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; guide to help new, and experienced, operators to resolve common problems that a service may encounter.
For example, a runbook may contain instructions on how to restart a service, provide definitions and steps to resolve issues for a service&amp;rsquo;s error codes, etc.</description>

      <description>Virtual Nodes Virtual nodes are read-only nodes which inherit all properties from a template node. They may only be created, updated, or deleted from their parent node.
Virtual modes can be considered as ephemeral, although their life span depends on the context.
The typical use case for virtual nodes is that you wish to quickly assign the same measurements to many nodes. In other words, they represent an asset or service that share the same properties.</description>

      <title>Invalid Call Parameters</title>

      <description>Invalid Call Parameters This error occurs when one or more sensor parameters are not configured. Depending on the sensor parameter, it either needs to be a string with one or more characters or a numeric value for integer and double types.
Please configure the measurement sensor parameters with a value.
Below is an example of a string sensor parameter that is not configured. In this context, simply add a value with one or more characters.</description>

      <title>Read-only Threshold</title>

      <description>Read-only Threshold When a Threshold is set as &amp;ldquo;read-only&amp;rdquo;, all other nodes that template from this measurement will be unable to change the configuration values of threshold actions.
Imagine you have a group of services which must send all alerting traffic to a specific Slack channel. You would turn on &amp;ldquo;read-only&amp;rdquo; in this context. In essence, this creates a central configuration point for your alerting configuration.
If you are creating a measurement template which will be used by many teams within (or outside) of your organization, the configuration values will most likely be different per team.</description>
